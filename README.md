# Waco

Daily aggregator of Waco biplane classified listings from
[Barnstormers.com](https://www.barnstormers.com), published as a static
page (`docs/index.html`) meant to be embedded via `<iframe>` on
taildraggers.com.

Controller.com was evaluated (in the companion [Aeronca](https://github.com/taildraggers/aeronca)
repo) and dropped: its search results are only reachable through an internal
client-side widget (not a plain URL), which a headless browser can't drive
reliably for an unattended daily job.

Note: in the companion [Aviat](https://github.com/taildraggers/aviat),
[CubCrafters](https://github.com/taildraggers/cub-crafters),
[de Havilland](https://github.com/taildraggers/de-Havilland),
[Maule](https://github.com/taildraggers/maule),
[Van's RV](https://github.com/taildraggers/vans),
[RANS](https://github.com/taildraggers/rans),
[Luscombe](https://github.com/taildraggers/luscombe),
[Just Aircraft](https://github.com/taildraggers/just-aircraft),
[Kitfox](https://github.com/taildraggers/kitfox),
[Bellanca](https://github.com/taildraggers/bellanca), and
[Stearman](https://github.com/taildraggers/stearman) repos, Barnstormers'
single-manufacturer category pages turned out to include unrelated
listings mixed in with no distinguishing HTML markup. This repo is built
with the same fix from day one: `scraper/barnstormers.py` filters by
title against a small allowlist (see `TARGET_MODEL_PHRASES` in
`scraper/barnstormers.py`) before publishing.

Waco used a notoriously varied model-designation system across decades -
mostly 2-3 letter codes where each letter historically indicated engine/
wing/fuselage type (the F-series: `INF`, `KNF`, `MNF`, `RNF`, `PCF`,
`PBF`, `QCF`, `UBF`, `UMF`, `UPF`, `ZPF`, `QNF`, `CPF`, `DPF`, `EPF`,
`VPF`, and the modern WACO Classic continuation `YMF`; plus older
Model-O-series codes like `ASO`, `CTO`, `ATO`, `CSO`, `GXE`; plus bare
numeric models like "Waco 10"). Rather than try to enumerate every
historical variant - a losing battle, since some are genuinely obscure -
a recognized code is trusted when present, but a bare mention of "Waco"
with no specific code stated is enough on its own to publish too (the
same lesson just learned in the companion Stearman repo), since plenty of
genuine listings just say "Waco biplane" without stating an exact
variant. Titles that read as parts, accessories, services, or raffles are
still dropped regardless. Every surviving listing's title is rewritten to
a canonical **`YEAR WACO MODEL`** form when the ad states a model year
and a specific model (e.g. `1943 Waco UPF-7`), `YEAR Waco` when only the
model is missing, `WACO MODEL` when only the year is missing, or plain
**`Waco`** when neither is stated.

**Gear note:** all Waco biplanes from this era share the same fixed,
non-retractable tailwheel gear by design - there is no tricycle-gear Waco
biplane - so no categorical gear exclusion is needed here (unlike RANS
S-19, Luscombe 11E, Kitfox Vixen/Voyager, or Van's RV's "A"-suffix
models). The standard text-based tricycle/nosewheel safety net used in
those repos is still applied to every listing as a general precaution.

## How it works

- `scraper/barnstormers.py` searches Barnstormers.com's Waco biplane
  category for listings, follows pagination, then keeps only the ones
  whose URL slug matches the Waco allowlist (Barnstormers builds each
  listing's URL slug directly from the ad's own title, so this runs
  before any detail page is fetched). For the matches, it visits each
  listing's detail page to pull out the price, location, and posted date
  (falling back to regex heuristics over the visible text since the site
  doesn't expose structured data). The title is derived from the listing
  URL's own SEO slug, since every detail page shares one generic
  `<title>`/`<h1>`; the final parsed title is checked against the
  allowlist again as a safety net. Pagination is built directly from
  Barnstormers' known `?seocategory=<url-encoded-path>&page=<n>` URL
  pattern rather than discovered by following a "Next" link, since this
  category's pager renders as page-number buttons with no "Next" text or
  `rel="next"` attribute to find (a lesson learned the hard way in the
  companion Van's RV repo, where the link-following approach silently
  stopped after page 1).
- `main.py` runs the scraper, de-duplicates results, sorts them
  newest-posted-first, and renders them into `docs/index.html` titled
  **"Other Waco Ads on the Web"**, with one row per listing: Title
  (linked to the original ad), Price, Location, Date Posted, and Site
  Posted On. Below phone width, each row collapses into a card (title +
  price on one line, location/date/site on a smaller line below) instead
  of a horizontally-scrolling table. Below the table, a "Search More
  Waco Listings" section links out to Trade-A-Plane, Controller, and
  ASO - sites that block automated scraping, but are still worth sending
  visitors to directly via a pre-filled search. Links use
  `rel="noopener noreferrer"` and the page sets a `no-referrer` meta
  policy, so none of these sites see that the click came from
  taildraggers.com.
- `.github/workflows/daily-scrape.yml` runs the whole thing once a day (13:00 UTC),
  commits the regenerated `docs/index.html` if it changed, and can also be triggered
  manually from the Actions tab (`workflow_dispatch`).

## One-time setup: enable GitHub Pages

This repo publishes `docs/index.html` as a plain static file — GitHub Pages just needs
to be pointed at it once:

1. Go to **Settings → Pages** in this repository.
2. Under **Build and deployment → Source**, choose **Deploy from a branch**.
3. Branch: `main`, folder: `/docs`. Save.
4. GitHub will publish the page at `https://taildraggers.github.io/waco/`
   (may take a minute or two the first time).

Also check **Settings → Actions → General**:
- **Actions permissions**: "Allow all actions and reusable workflows".
- **Workflow permissions**: "Read and write permissions" (needed so the daily
  job can commit the regenerated page back to the repo).

## Embedding on taildraggers.com

```html
<iframe
  src="https://taildraggers.github.io/waco/"
  title="Other Waco Ads on the Web"
  style="width: 100%; height: 800px; border: 0;"
  loading="lazy">
</iframe>
```

The page also posts its rendered height to the parent window on load/resize
(`{ type: "taildraggers:resize", height }`) so it can be auto-sized instead
of using a fixed guessed height - add a matching `message` listener on the
embedding page to pick this up.

## Running locally

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
playwright install --with-deps chromium
python main.py
```

This writes/overwrites `docs/index.html`.

## Notes

- If Barnstormers changes its markup or is briefly unreachable, the run logs will
  show a `[warn]`/`[error]` line pointing at what broke rather than failing silently.
- The scraper identifies itself with a browser-like `User-Agent` and adds a short
  delay between requests to be polite to the site.
- Only one Barnstormers category is currently configured
  (`category-17090-Biplane--Waco.html`). If listings turn out to be split
  across additional categories, add more URLs to `CATEGORY_URLS` in
  `scraper/barnstormers.py`.
- The model-code list in `_F_SERIES_CODES`/`_O_SERIES_CODES` isn't
  exhaustive of every Waco variant ever built. Missing a code isn't fatal
  since the bare-"Waco" fallback still publishes the listing (just
  without a specific model in the title) - but if a particular code turns
  up often enough to be worth naming explicitly, add it to those lists.
